#1. Project Workspace Setup
#Create a directory named documents inside your home directory. This directory will store your project-related files.
mkdir ~/documents
#2. File Creation
#Navigate into the documents directory and create a file named plan.txt.
cd ~/documents
touch plan.txt

#3. Content Addition
#Write some sample text of your choice into the plan.txt file. The content can be a short project note or reminder.
echo "This is a test file." > plan.txt

#4. File Metadata Verification
#Display the permissions and ownership details of the plan.txt file. Ensure your username appears in the output.
ls -l plan.txt

#5. File Duplication
#Create a copy of plan.txt and name it plan_copy.txt.
cp plan.txt plan_copy.txt

#6. Directory Renaming
#Rename the documents directory to project_documents to reflect the project scope more clearly.
cd ~
mv documents project_documents

#7. Archival Structure
#Inside the project_documents directory, create a subdirectory named archive.
cd ~
mv documents project_documents

#8. File Organization
#Move plan_copy.txt into the archive subdirectory.
mv plan_copy.txt archive/

#9. Recursive Listing
#List all files and subdirectories inside project_documents recursively so that the complete directory structure is visible.
ls -R ~/project_documents

#10. Path Verification
#Display the absolute path of the plan_copy.txt file after it has been moved to the archive directory.
realpath archive/plan_copy.txt
