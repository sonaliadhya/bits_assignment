#1. File Creation
#Create a file named sample_data.txt in your home directory and add some sample text to it.
echo "This is sample data for link verification." > ~/sample_data.txt
#2. Hard Link Creation
#Create a hard link to sample_data.txt named sample_hard.txt.
ln ~/sample_data.txt ~/sample_hard.txt
#3. Symbolic Link Creation
#Create a symbolic (soft) link to sample_data.txt named sample_soft.txt.
ln -s ~/sample_data.txt ~/sample_soft.txt
#4. Inode Verification
#Display the inode numbers of sample_data.txt, sample_hard.txt, and sample_soft.txt.
ls -i sample_data.txt sample_hard.txt sample_soft.txt
#5. Inode Analysis
#Identify which files share the same inode number and briefly explain the reason.
#Answer: sample_data.txt and sample_hard.txt share the same inode. This is because a hard link is an additional pointer to the same physical data on the disk. The symbolic link has a different inode because it is a separate file containing a path reference.
#6. File Metadata Inspection
#Display detailed file information (permissions, ownership, size, timestamps) of sample_data.txt.
stat sample_data.txt
#7. Disk Usage Check
#Display the disk usage of your home directory in a human-readable format.
du -sh ~
#8. File Size Overview
#Display the size of each file present in your home directory in a human-readable format.
ls -lh ~
#9. Link Deletion Test
#Delete the symbolic link sample_soft.txt and verify that the original file sample_data.txt is unaffected.
rm sample_soft.txt && ls -l sample_data.txt
#10. Disk Utility Demonstration
#Demonstrate the usage of du and df commands using various useful options and briefly explain the output.
df -hT
#Explanation: Displays available disk space on all mounted filesystems in human-readable format (-h) including the filesystem type (-T).
du -hc --max-depth=1 ~/
#Explanation: Summarizes disk usage for directories in the home folder, providing a grand total (-c) in human-readable format (-h) while limiting depth to one level.
